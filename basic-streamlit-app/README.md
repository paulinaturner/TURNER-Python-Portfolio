# Basic Streamlit App â€“ Penguin Dataset Explorer

## Description

This simple Streamlit app allows users to explore the Palmer Penguins dataset interactively. It displays the full dataset and enables users to filter penguins by bill length using a slider. The app is designed as an introduction to Streamlit's core features, including layout, user input, and live data display.
