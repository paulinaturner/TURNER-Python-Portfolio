# Turner-NERApp-Project README

This repository showcases a Streamlit web application that demonstrates Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy. The app allows users to interactively explore NER by uploading or typing their own text and creating custom entity patterns in real time.
#### AboutNER: 
Named Entity Recognition is widely used in news filtering, resume parsing, and market analysis. This app makes NER more accessible by allowing non-developers to interactively create, test, and visualize custom entity patterns.

### Description:
This app highlights spaCy’s powerful Named Entity Recognition functionality, specifically through the use of the `EntityRuler` pipeline component. Users can define custom entities by specifying both labels (e.g., BRAND, SCHOOL) and matching patterns (e.g., “Purely Pressed”, “Notre Dame”), and then immediately see those entities recognized and visualized in a user-friendly interface.
