# TURNER-Python-Portfolio
This repository will serve as my portfolio to showcase my projects, mini-projects, and overall Python Skills. It will be ordered by descending date and will include models and EDAs. 

## Basic Streamlit App
[Link to Project Portfolio Page on GitHub](https://github.com/paulinaturner/TURNER-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)
### Description:
This simple Streamlit app allows users to explore the Palmer Penguins dataset interactively. It displays the full dataset and enables users to filter penguins by bill length using a slider. The app is designed as an introduction to Streamlit's core features, including layout, user input, and live data display.

### How This Project Enhances the Portfolio
This project reflects my ability to build and deploy interactive web apps using Streamlit. It demonstrates essential skills in loading real-world data, enabling dynamic user interaction through widgets, and structuring clean data displays. As a foundational Streamlit project, it helped solidify my understanding of user-centered data tools.
   #### Key Skills Showcased in This Project
      Streamlit Layout and Widgets
      Interactive Filtering with Sliders
      CSV Data Loading and Display
      Real-time DataFrame Filtering
      Introductory Web App Development with Python

## Tidy Data Project
[Link to Project Page on Github](https://github.com/paulinaturner/TURNER-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project) 
### Description:
The Tidy Data Project serves as a practical application of tidy data principles and provides a structured approach to handling and analyzing real-world datasets. I practiced melting & cleaning, and creating visualizations to analyze the data. 

###  How This Project Enhances My Coding Portfolio
This Tidy Data Project is a strong addition to my coding portfolio as it demonstrates key data cleaning, transformation, and visualization skills (essential for data analysis, business intelligence, and machine learning applications).
   #### Key Skills Showcased in This Project
   Data Wrangling 
   Exploratory Data Analysis
   Markdown and Documentation
   GitHub Workflow

   This project reinforces my ability to work with messy datasets and transform them into structured, actionable insights, making me 
   a strong candidate for roles in data analysis, business intelligence, and data science. 

## NER Streamlit App

### Description:
This Streamlit application is a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) tool built using spaCy. The app allows users to input or upload text, define their own entity patterns (like names of brands, schools, etc.), and see those entities highlighted in real time. It leverages spaCyâ€™s `EntityRuler` component to apply user-defined rules and visualize extracted named entities directly in the browser.

### How This Project Enhances My Coding Portfolio
This project demonstrates my ability to integrate natural language processing techniques into an interactive front-end experience using Streamlit. 
   #### Key Skills Showcased in This Project
      spaCy NLP  
      Streamlit Development  
      Pattern Matching with EntityRuler  
      Interactive UI/UX Design  
      Requirements Management and App Deployment

## Streamlit App Final, CLV Calculator
[Link to Project Page on GitHub](https://github.com/paulinaturner/TURNER-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/StreamlitAppFinal)

### Description:
This interactive Streamlit app helps users estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) based on inputs like customer behavior, product type, and financial assumptions. It supports both individual customer analysis and batch processing via CSV upload. The app also provides decision-support messages based on the calculated CLV and acquisition cost.

### How This Project Enhances My Coding Portfolio
This project reflects my ability to build interactive Python applications with:
- Real-time user interaction
- NLP customization
- Clean UX/UI layout using Streamlit
It demonstrates my growing expertise in natural language processing, user-centric design, and deploying functional tools for exploratory text analysis.
   #### Key Skills Showcased in This Project
      Streamlit App Development  
      Natural Language Processing with spaCy  
      EntityRuler Pattern Matching  
      User Interface Design  
      Python Logic & State Management
