# TURNER-Python-Portfolio
This repository will serve as my portfolio to showcase my projects, mini-projects, and overall Python Skills. It will be ordered by descending date and will include models and EDAs. 
## Tidy Data Project
[Link to Project Page on Github](https://github.com/paulinaturner/TURNER-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project) 
### Description:
The Tidy Data Project serves as a practical application of tidy data principles and provides a structured approach to handling and analyzing real-world datasets. I practiced melting & cleaning, and creating visualizations to analyze the data. 

###  How This Project Enhances My Coding Portfolio
This Tidy Data Project is a strong addition to my coding portfolio as it demonstrates key data cleaning, transformation, and visualization skills (essential for data analysis, business intelligence, and machine learning applications).
   #### Key Skills Showcased in This Project
   Data Wrangling 

   Exploratory Data Analysis

   Markdown and Documentation

   GitHub Workflow

   This project reinforces my ability to work with messy datasets and transform them into structured, actionable insights, making me 
   a strong candidate for roles in data analysis, business intelligence, and data science. 

## NER Streamlit App
[Link to Project Page on GitHub](https://github.com/paulinaturner/TURNER-Python-Portfolio/blob/07f37726645a6b28a97a4120f77daf6cc2ad9734/NERStreamlitApp/NERStreamlitApp.py)

### Description:
This Streamlit application is a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) tool built using spaCy. The app allows users to input or upload text, define their own entity patterns (like names of brands, schools, etc.), and see those entities highlighted in real time. It leverages spaCy’s `EntityRuler` component to apply user-defined rules and visualize extracted named entities directly in the browser.

### How This Project Enhances My Coding Portfolio
This project demonstrates my ability to integrate natural language processing techniques into an interactive front-end experience using Streamlit. It complements my portfolio by showcasing skills in:

   Web app development
   
   NLP customization with spaCy
   
   Real-time user input handling
   
   Pattern-based matching and visualization

#### Key Skills Showcased in This Project
- spaCy NLP  
- Streamlit Development  
- Pattern Matching with EntityRuler  
- Interactive UI/UX Design  
- Requirements Management and App Deployment

## StreamlitApp Final, CLV Calculator
[Link to Project Page on GitHub](https://github.com/paulinaturner/TURNER-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/StreamlitAppFinal)

### Description:
This interactive Streamlit app helps users estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) based on inputs like customer behavior, product type, and financial assumptions. It supports both individual customer analysis and batch processing via CSV upload. The app also provides decision-support messages based on the calculated CLV and acquisition cost.

### How This Project Enhances My Coding Portfolio
This project reflects my ability to build interactive Python applications with:
- Real-time user interaction
- NLP customization
- Clean UX/UI layout using Streamlit

It demonstrates my growing expertise in natural language processing, user-centric design, and deploying functional tools for exploratory text analysis.
#### Key Skills Showcased in This Project
- Streamlit App Development  
- Natural Language Processing with spaCy  
- EntityRuler Pattern Matching  
- User Interface Design  
- Python Logic & State Management
