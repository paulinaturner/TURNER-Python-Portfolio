# TURNER-Python-Portfolio
This repository will serve as my portfolio to showcase my projects, mini-projects, and overall Python Skills. It will be ordered by descending date and will include models and EDAs. 
## Tidy Data Project
[Link to Project Page on Github](https://github.com/paulinaturner/TURNER-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project) 
### Description:
The Tidy Data Project serves as a practical application of tidy data principles and provides a structured approach to handling and analyzing real-world datasets. I practiced melting & cleaning, and creating visualizations to analyze the data. 

###  How This Project Enhances My Coding Portfolio
This Tidy Data Project is a strong addition to my coding portfolio as it demonstrates key data cleaning, transformation, and visualization skills (essential for data analysis, business intelligence, and machine learning applications).
   #### Key Skills Showcased in This Project
   Data Wrangling 

   Exploratory Data Analysis

   Markdown and Documentation

   GitHub Workflow

   This project reinforces my ability to work with messy datasets and transform them into structured, actionable insights, making me 
   a strong candidate for roles in data analysis, business intelligence, and data science. 

## NER Streamlit App

### Description:
This Streamlit application is a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) tool built using spaCy. The app allows users to input or upload text, define their own entity patterns (like names of brands, schools, etc.), and see those entities highlighted in real time. It leverages spaCyâ€™s `EntityRuler` component to apply user-defined rules and visualize extracted named entities directly in the browser.

### How This Project Enhances My Coding Portfolio
This project demonstrates my ability to integrate natural language processing techniques into an interactive front-end experience using Streamlit. It complements my portfolio by showcasing skills in:

- Web app development
- NLP customization with spaCy
- Real-time user input handling
- Pattern-based matching and visualization

#### Key Skills Showcased in This Project
- spaCy NLP  
- Streamlit Development  
- Pattern Matching with EntityRuler  
- Interactive UI/UX Design  
- Requirements Management and App Deployment
